# Submitting for production (panelized by manufacturer)

If manufacturer panelizes, we should create
gerber files for a single PCB.

From pcbnew open PCB, view it and menu

    File->Plot

Click "Plot" to create gerbers and click "Generate Drill File"
another window will open. Click "Drill file" to create drill files.

Generate footprint positions

    File->Fabrication Outputs->Footprint Position (.pos) File

Generate floorplan PDF for top and bottom side

    File->Print
    [x] F.Fab  [ ] Print Mirrored
    [x] B.Fab  [x] Print Mirrored

RAR or ZIP to a file

    cd plot
    rar a  /tmp/ulx3s-pcb.rar gerbers
    zip -r /tmp/ulx3s-pcb.zip gerbers

Open [Seeedstudio PCB production](https://www.seeedstudio.com/fusion_pcb.html)
page, select:

    Size: 94x51 mm
    Layer: 4-layer board
    Min Solder Mask: 0.1 mm
    Min Hole size: 0.2 mm
    Min Tracking/Spacing: 5/5 mils
    Quality: IPC Class 3

click "Add your gerber file" and upload this rar file then
click on "Gerber Viewer" to see what will be produced.

Exporting for production:

Drill file:
[x] Excellon format
[x] inch units
[x] suppress trailing zeros
[x] PTH and NPTH in the same file

Footprint position file:
[x] ASCII format
[x] mm units

# Submitting for production (panelized by us)

If we panelize, we should create gerbers for panel
and the stencil. Gerbers should have a file describing
depanelization cuts (vertical v-cuts and horizontal mill
lines).

Install [KiKit](https://github.com/yaqwsx/KiKit) or upgrade

    pip3 uninstall kikit
    pip3 install git+https://github.com/yaqwsx/KiKit@master
    pip3 install --upgrade git+https://github.com/yaqwsx/KiKit@master
    pip3 show kikit
    Version: 0.99-pre1.0+35.g4fe4b78

Generate gerbers in RAR file (needs "KiKit" and "rar" installed)

    make

View panel gerbers with gerbv:

    cd plot
    gerbv (File->Open ulx3s-panel.gvp, F5 to refresh)

Count number of pads in gerbv:

    select visible either PasteTop or PasteBottom layer.
    (all other layers de-selected)
    Analyze->Analyze visible Gerber layers->D codes
    D03 count (flash aperture) is the number of pads.
    PasteTop    : 4464 pads
    PasteBottom : 1016 pads

Check [JLCPCB extra costs](https://support.jlcpcb.com/article/62-what-cases-will-be-charged-of-extra-cost).
For stencil, up to 1000 pads above 4000 they charge 4.3$,
so they will ask for additional 9.6$ because
stencil has 4464 pads on top and 1016 on bottom, 
total 5480 pads.
